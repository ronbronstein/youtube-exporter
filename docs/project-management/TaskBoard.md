**Assignee:** Development Team | **Status:** üî¥ BLOCKED  
**Started:** 2025-01-27

**Description:**
Fix completely broken analytics generation causing entire analytics section to disappear.

**Critical Issues Found:**
- `this.services.analytics.generateAnalytics()` method doesn't exist in AnalyticsService
- Console error: "this.services.analytics.generateAnalytics is not a function"
- App.js expects unified analytics object but service only has individual methods
- No analytics displayed in any mode (Demo/Live)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create unified `generateAnalytics()` method in AnalyticsService
- [ ] Map individual methods (generateContentAnalysis, identifyViralContent, etc.) to expected structure
- [ ] Fix return object structure: {overview: {totalVideos, totalViews, averageViews}, topVideos: {byViews}, insights: []}
- [ ] Test analytics display in both Demo and Live modes
- [ ] Restore analytics section visibility

- Filter controls appear to work but don't actually filter data
- No "X videos match filters of Y total" display

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Debug filtering logic in VideoService

**Critical Issues Found:**
- Keywords from initial input not passed as tags to results search box
- Cache not persisting across page refreshes in demo mode
- API key state lost when switching between modes
- Demo mode button available after API key validated (should be disabled)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Fix initial keyword transfer from input to search tags
- [ ] Implement proper cache persistence for demo mode
- [ ] Fix mode switching to preserve appropriate state
- [ ] Disable demo mode after successful API validation
- [ ] Test state isolation between modes

**Epic:** EPIC-018 | **Story:** 18.4 | **Points:** 5 | **Priority:** P1 - HIGH  
**Assignee:** Development Team | **Status:** üî¥ BROKEN  

**Description:**
API key validation UX is broken causing user confusion and insecurity.

**Critical Issues Found:**
- Validation button stuck on "validating..." after successful validation
- API section not auto-collapsing after validation
- API key displayed as plain text instead of password field
- Missing validation feedback and next steps

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Fix validation button state management
- [ ] Implement auto-collapse of API section after validation
- [ ] Change API key input to password type
- [ ] Add clear validation success feedback
- [ ] Guide user to next steps after validation

## üóÇÔ∏è **DELETED FILES REFERENCE**
**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Reason:** Cleanup/refactoring  

**Files Removed:**
- `src/css/components/analytics.css` - May be needed for analytics styling
- `.cursorrules-css` - CSS cursor rules 
- `docs/cursor-rules/ui-components.mdc` - UI component guidelines
- `docs/CSS_AUDIT_SUMMARY.md` - CSS audit documentation

**Action Required:**
- [ ] Verify if analytics.css removal contributed to analytics display issues
- [ ] Check if UI component rules need restoration for consistent styling
- [ ] Review if CSS audit findings are still relevant
