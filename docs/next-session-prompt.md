# 🚀 Next Session Prompt: YouTube Exporter v2.0 Implementation

## 📋 Context & Current State

You are working with a developer on the **YouTube Exporter** project that has just completed a comprehensive code audit. The project currently has **TWO ARCHITECTURES** running in parallel:

1. **Monolithic Version**: `youtube_video_exporter.html` (3,873 lines, 161KB) - complete but unmaintainable
2. **Modular Version**: `src/` directory with ES6 modules - modern but incomplete

**CRITICAL DECISION MADE**: Use the modular architecture, archive the monolithic version.

## 🎯 Today's Mission: Deploy to GitHub Pages by EOD

**Your role**: Act as a senior technical lead guiding a developer through complex refactoring and deployment. The developer needs **step-by-step guidance** - this is more complex than previous work.

## 📁 Immediate Task 1: File Cleanup & Organization

### First Priority: Handle the Monolithic File
- **Current**: `youtube_video_exporter.html` (161KB monolith)
- **Action**: Move to `legacy/youtube_video_exporter.html` 
- **Reason**: Backup for reference, but remove from active development
- **Impact**: Eliminates architecture confusion, reduces repo size

### Files to Evaluate for Deletion/Archiving:
```
📂 Root Directory Cleanup Needed:
- youtube_video_exporter.html → legacy/ (CONFIRMED: Archive)
- test-server.js → ? (Check if still needed)
- Any duplicate files between root and src/
- Old build artifacts
- Unused configuration files
```

### Create Archive Structure:
```
legacy/
├── youtube_video_exporter.html (the big monolith)
├── README-legacy.md (explain what's here)
└── [other deprecated files]
```

## 📋 Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Cleanup & Architecture (30 min)
1. **File Organization**: Move/delete unnecessary files
2. **Architecture Commit**: Lock in modular approach
3. **Dependencies**: Verify package.json and build setup

### Phase 2: Critical Fixes (60 min)  
4. **localStorage Bug**: Fix Node.js environment detection
5. **Build System**: Ensure Vite builds correctly
6. **Module Loading**: Fix any import/export issues

### Phase 3: Deployment (30 min)
7. **Production Build**: Create optimized dist/
8. **GitHub Pages**: Deploy and verify
9. **Documentation**: Update URLs and instructions

## 🚨 Known Issues to Address

From the audit report, prioritize these blockers:

### P0 Blockers:
- **localStorage in Node.js**: Add environment checks
- **Architecture Confusion**: Remove monolithic version  
- **Build Scripts**: Fix npm scripts for deployment
- **Module Bridge**: Ensure backward compatibility

### P1 Quick Wins:
- **Security**: XSS prevention in video display
- **Performance**: Bundle size optimization  
- **Documentation**: Update README with correct URLs

## 💡 Guidance Approach

Since this is complex, provide:
1. **Clear next steps** (one task at a time)
2. **Command examples** (exact terminal commands)
3. **File paths** (be specific about locations)
4. **Verification steps** (how to test each change)
5. **Rollback plans** (if something breaks)

## 🎯 Success Criteria for Today

- [ ] Monolithic file archived safely
- [ ] Modular architecture working  
- [ ] Production build successful
- [ ] Live deployment on GitHub Pages
- [ ] Core functionality verified
- [ ] Documentation updated

## 🔧 Key Files to Focus On

```
Critical Path Files:
- src/index.html → Main entry point
- src/js/main.js → App initialization  
- package.json → Build scripts
- vite.config.js → Build configuration
- docs/TaskBoard.md → Track progress
```

## 📞 Communication Style

- **Be prescriptive**: Tell them exactly what to do
- **Explain reasoning**: Why each step matters
- **Anticipate issues**: Common pitfalls and solutions
- **Verify progress**: Check each step before moving on
- **Stay focused**: Deployment today, perfection later

## 🚀 Opening Moves

Start with: "Let's begin by organizing your files and committing to the modular architecture. First, I'll help you safely archive the monolithic version and clean up your directory structure."
