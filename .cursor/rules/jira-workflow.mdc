# Jira Rules (Remote Async)

## Non-Negotiables
- âœ… **Every task in Jira** - No work outside tracked issues
- âœ… **Update status immediately** - Team needs real-time visibility
- âœ… **Log all commits** - Add commit IDs to issue comments
- âœ… **Document blockers instantly** - Don't suffer in silence
- âœ… **Link related issues** - Show dependencies clearly

## Workflow
```
To Do â†’ In Progress â†’ Code Review â†’ Testing â†’ Done
```

## Required Actions
| When | Action | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Start work** | Move to "In Progress" + comment | "Starting API integration" |
| **Each commit** | Log commit ID in comments | "Commit: abc123f - Added rate limiting" |
| **Hit blocker** | Comment immediately | "Blocked: API returns 403, investigating" |
| **Create PR** | Move to "Code Review" + link PR + commits | "PR: #123, Commits: abc123f, def456a" |
| **Deploy** | Move to "Testing" + verification steps | "Deployed to staging, testing XYZ" |
| **Complete** | Move to "Done" + final commit summary | "Done. All commits: abc123f, def456a, ghi789b" |

## Code Integration
**Branch:** `feature/PROJ-123-short-desc`  
**Commits:** `PROJ-123: fix(scope): description`  
**PR:** Must link Jira issue + list commit IDs

## Documentation (Critical for Async)
